Title: Fair Data Adaptation with Quantile Preservation
Description: An implementation of the fair data adaptation with quantile
    preservation described in Plecko & Meinshausen (JMLR 2020, 21(242), 1-44).
    The adaptation procedure uses the specified causal graph to pre-process the
    given training and testing data in such a way to remove the bias caused by
    the protected attribute. The procedure uses tree ensembles for quantile
    regression. Instructions for using the methods are further elaborated in 
    the corresponding JSS manuscript, see <doi:10.18637/jss.v110.i04>.
